- **Failed Images**: 19 (mostly R tutorial images and LaTeX formulas)
- **Output Location**: `/mnt/c/ats/ph1t/el2za/zorro-docs-crawler/zorro-docs-output/`
- **Format**: Clean Markdown with frontmatter and local images
- **Structure**: GitHub-friendly with context7.json configuration

## Files Generated
- `README.md` - Main documentation readme
- `SUMMARY.md` - Complete table of contents with navigation
- `context7.json` - Configuration for Context7 integration
- `docs/` - 249 Markdown files containing all documentation
- `images/` - 109 image files referenced in the documentation

## Quality Features
- ✅ Clean HTML to Markdown conversion
- ✅ Preserved code blocks with C syntax highlighting
- ✅ Maintained internal cross-references
- ✅ Added source URLs in frontmatter
- ✅ Hierarchical organization based on TOC structure
- ✅ Sanitized filenames for cross-platform compatibility
- ✅ Fixed internal links to use relative paths and .md extensions
- ✅ Downloaded and localized most images

## Known Issues

Some images failed to download:
- R tutorial images (HTTP 300 errors - server misconfiguration)
- LaTeX formula images (404 errors - broken links in source)

These represent a small fraction of the total images and don't significantly impact the documentation quality.

## Next Steps

1. **Get Permission**
   - Use the email template to contact Zorro's creator
   - Explain the purpose (improved accessibility, Context7 integration)
   - Request permission to host on GitHub

2. **Once Permission is Granted**
   ```bash
   # Create GitHub repository
   cd zorro-docs-output
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Zorro documentation mirror with images"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/zorro-docs-mirror.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Submit to Context7**
   - Go to https://context7.com/add-package
   - Submit your GitHub repository URL
   - Wait for indexing

4. **Use in Claude**
   - Once indexed, you can use Context7 to retrieve up-to-date Zorro documentation
   - Example: `mcp__context7__get-library-docs --library="/yourusername/zorro-docs-mirror"`

## Email Template for Permission

```
Subject: Request to Create Community Mirror of Zorro Documentation

Dear Zorro Team,

I'm a Zorro user who has created a tool to convert the Zorro documentation into Markdown format for improved accessibility and integration with modern development tools.

The benefits of this conversion include:
- Better searchability and indexing
- Integration with AI coding assistants through Context7
- Offline access for developers
- Responsive viewing on mobile devices

I would like to request permission to:
1. Host this converted documentation on GitHub as a community resource
2. Submit it to Context7 for integration with AI coding tools

The repository would clearly state:
- It's an unofficial mirror
- All content belongs to oP group Germany
- Users should refer to the official documentation for the latest information
- Include links back to the official Zorro website

Would this be acceptable to you? I'm happy to make any adjustments you require.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```
