# brokerCommand

## brokerCommand (int Command, **intptr\_t** Parameter): var

## brokerCommand (int Command, string Text)

## brokerCommand (int Command, var\* Parameters)

Sets various broker plugin parameters or retrieves asset specific data for special purposes in a script in \[Trade\] mode. The functions can be optionally provided by the [broker plugin](brokerplugin.md); they return **0** when they are not supported or no broker connection is established. The number and types of parameters depend on **Command**. User specific commands to the broker API can be added.The following commands are predefined:

| **SET\_DELAY** | Time in ms |   | Set delay in ms between commands sent to the broker (normally 20). |
| **SET\_WAIT** | Time in ms |   | Set maximum wait time in ms for confirmation after a command was sent to the broker. Default depends on the broker plugin; normally 60000. Increase the time when trades need longer than 1 minute to open. |
| **GET\_MAXTICKS** | 0 | ✔ | Return the maximum number of ticks to be filled by [BrokerHistory2](brokerplugin.md). If this command is not supported, it's 300 ticks. This command is called at login to set the [MaxTicks](187_TickTime_MaxRequests.md) variable. |

| **SET\_SLIPPAGE** | Pips |   | Set the maximum allowed slippage (**default = 5 pips**) in adverse direction for subsequently opening or closing trades. Higher allowed slippage causes less requotes, but allows trades to be entered at a worse price. Note that the allowed slippage is not guaranteed; trades can be still entered at higher slippage dependent on the brokerm, market access method, and server setup. |
| **SET\_SYMBOL** | Symbol | ✔ | Set the symbol for subsequent commands. |
| **SET\_MAGIC** | Number |   | Set a "magic number" for identifying trades opened by the current script. |
| **SET\_MULTIPLIER** | Number | ✔ | Set the multiplier for retrieving option and future chains. |

| **SET\_FUNCTIONS** | Function pointer | ✔ | Called before login with a pointer to Zorro's [function list](funclist.md), an array of function pointers in the order given by **include\\func\_list.h**. This allows the plugin to call Zorro functions, such as HTTP or hash functions for REST APIs, by their number (see example).  |
| **GET\_CALLBACK** | Address  
pointer | ✔ | Get the address of a plugin-supplied callback function that is called at any **WM\_APP+3** message; automatically called after login. |
| **SET\_BROKER** | Text |   | Set the broker or exchange name when a plugin supports multiple brokers or exchanges. Returns 0 when the name did not match any, otherwise nonzero. |
| **SET\_SERVER** | Text | ✔ | Send the optional URL in the account list **Server** field to the broker API. Automatically called before login. Can be used to set a different URL for REST endpoints. |
| **SET\_CCY** | Text | ✔ | Send the currency part of the account list CCY field to the broker API. Automatically called before any **BrokerAccount** call. |

| **SET\_COMBO\_LEGS** | 2, 3, 4 | ✔ | Declare the given number of following [option trades](096_contract.md) as a combo order. Most brokers offer reduced margin and commission on combos. To use, set the combo leg number and immediately call the [enter](buylong.md) commands for the contracts. The order will be processed after the last **enter** command is received. If the order fails, the last **enter** will return **0**. The script must then [cancel](selllong.md) the prior trades. All combo trades must have matching expiration dates  and underlying symbols; otherwise the order will not be accepted. |
| **SET\_ORDERTYPE** | 0 ... 11 | ✔ | Switch between order types and return the type if supported by the broker plugin, otherwise 0. Automatically called at any order entry depending on [TradeMode](018_TradeMode.md) and [StopFactor](188_Stop_Profit_Trail_Entry.md).  
**0**  - Broker default (highest fill probability)  
**1**  - AON (all.or-none); prevents partial fills  
**2**  - GTC (good-till-cancelled); order stays open until completely filled  
**3** -  AON+GTC  
**4** - Broker specific special order type  
**+8** - STOP; add a stop order at distance [Stop\*StopFactor](188_Stop_Profit_Trail_Entry.md) on NFA accounts (see remarks).  |
| **SET\_ORDERTEXT** | Text |   | Set an arbitrary order comment for the next order (255 characters max). Often also used for special orders, f.i. for trading binary options with MT4, or for special order types like "STP LMT" with IB. Reset with an empty string. |
| **SET\_ORDERGROUP** | Text |   | Set an order group name for the next orders (255 characters max). Often used for grouping orders together, f.i. for One-Cancels-Another (OCA) orders, depending in the broker. Reset with an empty string. |
| **SET\_PRICETYPE** | 0 ... 8 |   | Set the type of prices returned by **BrokerAsset** and **BrokerHistory2**, if applicable. Return the type if supported by the broker plugin, otherwise **0.  
0** - Broker default (normally ask or last trade price);**  
1** - enforce ask/bid quotes;**  
2** - enforce last trade price;**  
3** - special (broker specific);**  
4** - suppress price requests;**  
5** - enforce ask prices**,  
6** - enforce bid prices,**  
7** - adjusted last trade price (for historical data);**  
8** - fast price requests: ask, bid, or trade, whatever received first.  
The [spread](191_Spread_Commission.md) is normally only updated when ask/bid quotes are returned. |
| **SET\_VOLTYPE** | 0 ... 7 |   | Set the type of volume data returned by **BrokerAsset** and **BrokerHistory2**, if applicable. Return the type if supported by the broker plugin, otherwise **0.**

A 32 bit <strong>int</strong> or pointer for 32 bit plugins, or a 64 bit <strong>long int</strong> or pointer for 64 bit plugins.</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 121px"><strong>Parameters, P</strong></td><td>Input, array of up to 8 <strong>var</strong>s for commands that set or retrieve multiple parameters.</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 121px"><strong>Symbol</strong></td><td>Input, <strong>char*</strong>, broker symbol of an asset (see <a href="script.htm">Symbol</a>). Complex symbols, as for selected option contracts, can have the underlying, exchange, expiry, and other parameters coded in the name as described under <a href="ib.htm">IB Bridge</a>.</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 121px"><strong>Text</strong></td><td>Input, <strong>char*</strong>, for commands that require a text string.</td></tr></tbody></table>

 

### Returns:

**0** when the command is not supported by the broker plugin, otherwise the data to be retrieved.  
   

## brokerAsset (string Symbol, var\* pPrice, var\* pSpread, var \*pVol)

Call the [BrokerAsset](brokerplugin.md) function with the given **Symbol** (f.i. [SymbolLive](script.md)) and return the price, spread, and volume.

## brokerAccount (string Name, string AccountID, var \*pBalance, var \*pTradeVal, var \*pMarginVal);

Call the [BrokerAccount](brokerplugin.md) function for the [account list](013_Asset_Account_Lists.md) entry given by **Name** and an optional account identifer, and return the balance, open trade value, and allocated margin. Can be used to retrieve account information when trading with [multiple brokers](brokerarb.md).

## brokerRequest (string Path, string Method, string Data): string

Call the [BrokerRequest](brokerplugin.md) function for sending arbitrary HTTP requests to the connected REST API. **Path** is the relative URL including the query string, but without the endpoint root. If **Method** begins with '**$**', the request will be signed. **Data** is the optional request body. If no particulat **Method** and no body is given, a **GET** request is sent. The response is returned and can be evaluated.

## brokerTrades (int Filter): int

Call the **GET\_TRADES** command. Cancel all currently open trades, and replace them with the open positions on the broker account (if any).**  
Filter = 0** loads all positions,**  
Filter = 1** loads only positions matching the asset list,**  
Filter = 2** loads only positions of assets that were already selected in the script,  
**Filter = 4** loads only positions of the current asset and prevents the previous cancelling of open trades.  
Add **16** to **Filter** for adjusting [TradeUnits](018_TradeMode.md) and [TradePriceOpen](018_TradeMode.md) by the [Multiplier](contracts.md), as needed for option contracts with some broker APIs.  
The function returns the number of entered positions. It can synchronize script trades with the broker account. The account must support the **GET\_TRADES** command and have only open positions from the current Zorro script. The [enterTrade](buylong.md) function is used for entering the new trades. The entered trades are plain, without exit limits, TMFs, flags, TradeVars, or any other trade parameter that is not stored on the broker account. The algo identifiers of the trades are set to the current [algo](095_algo.md). For correctly updating the trades, all assets must have been used in the script.     

### Remarks:

*   Commands marked internal are automatically sent by Zorro to the broker plugin. They need normally not be used in the script. The other commands are not used by Zorro and available to the script. If a command is not supported, it returns **0**. Which of the commands are supported can be found on the description page of the broker plugin.
*   The **SET\_PATCH** command is always supported since it's handled on the Zorro side. It lets Zorro estimate account and trade parameters, rather than using the values from the broker API. This is required when the broker API calculates those parameters wrong, as was the case for the account balance, equity, and open trade profit in some FXCM API versions. Replacing those parameters has no effect on trading, but on the displayed equity and profit values on the Zorro panel. The estimated equity includes only the profit by trades of the current strategy, and thus is different to the account equity when other systems trade on the same account. The estimated trade result can also differ to the real result due to slippage and rollover.
*   For preventing the interruption of a command sequence by another Zorro instance -  f.i. for setting order parameters before sending the order - use either the **SET\_LOCK** command (if available) or the [lock](167_lock_unlock.md) function. They work like a Windows Mutex. Before the sequence, use **while(0 == brokerCommand(SET\_LOCK,1)) wait(5);** for waiting until the lock was released, and setting it then. Afterwards, **brokerCommand(SET\_LOCK,0)** releases the lock after sending the command sequence. If **SET\_LOCK** is not supported by the plugin, use the [lock/unlock](167_lock_unlock.md) functions in a simular way to lock the part of the code.
*   If the script connects to multiple brokers, commands are sent to the broker assigned to trading with the the current asset ([SourceTrade](script.md)).
*   Contract chains by **GET\_OPTIONS** or **GET\_FOP** are filled with the following data from the **CONTRACT** struct, which is defined in **include\\trading.h**:  
    **time:** a null-terminated string of up to 7 chars containing the trading class symbol (if available)  
    **fAsk**, **fBid**: the ask and bid price (if available)  
    **fStrike:**  the strike price  
    **fVal:** the multiplier (if available)  
    **Expiry:**  the expiration date in YYYYMMDD format  
    **Type:**   the contract type, **PUT, CALL, FUTURE, EUROPEAN, BINARY**; optionally an exchange identifier coded in the upper 16 bits.
*   Trade arrays by **GET\_TRADES** are filled with the following position data (the **TRADE** struct is defined in **include\\trading.h**):  
    **nId:**  a unique trade identifier (if available)  
    **nLots**: the position amount  
    **flags:**  **TR\_SHORT** for short positions  
    **fEntryPrice:** the average entry price if available; some brokers (IB) multiply the entry price with the options multiplier.  
    **fStrike:** the strike price if applicable  
    **tExitDate**:  the expiration date in **DATE** format (if applicable)  
    **nContract:**  the contract type if applicable, i.e. **PUT** or **CALL**; optionally an exchange identifier coded in the upper 16 bits. If the **FUTURE**, **EUROPEAN**, **BINARY** flags are not available via broker API, they must be set by script.  
    **sInfo**: the trading class symbol (if applicable)
*   Variables or text set up with **brokerCommand** keep their content until modified by another **brokerCommand**. Take care of this when a previous trading session has used this command to set a variable or text.
*   If the broker API provides no information about trades - as is the case for most NFA compliant APIs - make sure to keep the trades on the Zorro side and the broker side in sync. Don't close positions or cancel orders on one side only.
*   If the broker API supports a particular order type, the plugin returns the ordertype on the **SET\_ORDERTYPE** command; otherwise it returns **0**.
*   **SET\_ORDERTYPE** >= **8** places a separate stop order when supported by the broker. Dependent on the behavior of the broker API, this order might stay alive even when the original trade was closed. In that case cancel it manually: Send a **DO\_CANCEL** command with the stop order trade ID, which is normally the original trade ID +1. Otherwise the stop order might stay open and trigger an unwanted position in reverse direction.
*   Not all price types are supported with all assets. Check with your broker which prices types are supported, and make sure to use **SET\_PRICETYPE** only when available for the selected asset.Otherwise leave it at **0**
S*   Some commands send a 32 bit pointer as parameter, for instance to pass a **string** or one or several **double** variables to the plugin. The broker plugin can then cast it to the required type for getting the content, f.i. **double NewLotAmount = \*(double\*)Parameter;**
*   User defined commands for special broker API settings can be defined with a command number > 2000. Numbers below 2000 are reserved for predefined commands.
