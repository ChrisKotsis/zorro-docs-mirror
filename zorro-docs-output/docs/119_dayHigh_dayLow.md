# dayHigh, dayLow, ...

## dayOpen (int zone, int day) : var

## dayClose (int zone, int day) : var

## dayHigh (int zone, int day) : var

## dayLow (int zone, int day) : var

## dayPivot (int zone, int day) : var

Returns the open, close, high, low, and pivot point within the [market hours](100_tradeUpdate.md) (by default, 9:30 am until 16:00 pm) of a given working day and time zone. Can be used for seasonal trading, gap trading, or daily price action. The pivot point is defined as **(High+Low+Close)/3**.  

### Parameters:

<table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><strong>zone</strong></td><td><strong>UTC</strong> for UTC time or <strong>ET</strong> for New York time, or a number giving the zone offset in hours to UTC. Daylight saving time is considered in non-UTC zones from 2000 to 2019.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>day</strong></td><td>Working day offset, i.e. <strong>0</strong> = today (see remarks), <strong>1</strong> = yesterday, <strong>2</strong> = day before yesterday, and so on. Weekends are skipped, f.i. if today is Monday, <strong>1</strong> refers to last Friday.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Returns

Price.

### Usage:

**dayClose(ET,1)** returns yesterday's closing price of the current asset at the New York Stock Exchange.

### Remarks:

*   During the [LookBack](nhistory.md) period all day price functions return **0**.
*   The [BarPeriod](177_BarPeriod_TimeFrame.md) matters for precision. F.i. for a time precision of 30 minutes, use a **BarPeriod** of 30 or below. The functions do not work for bar periods above one day.
*   Time travel attempts - for instance requesting today's high, low, or close price when the market is still open - will cause a "negative price offset" warning when the [PEEK](018_TradeMode.md) flag is not set.
*   Market hours can be changed through the global variables **[StartMarket](100_tradeUpdate.md)** (default: **930**) and **[EndMarket](100_tradeUpdate.md)** (default: **1600**) in the **hhmm** format. If the hours don't matter, use alternatively the [price](022_Price_History.md) functions from daily bars, or the [HH](033_W4a_Indicator_implementation.md) / [LL](033_W4a_Indicator_implementation.md) functions. Daily bars change at midnight UTC. By setting **StartMarket** and **EndMarket** accordingly, arbitrary time periods can be used. F.i. for getting the high-low range of the first hour of a trading day, set **StartMarket** at **930** and **EndMarket** at **1030**. **EndMarket** must be higher than **StartMarket**.
*   Some traders believe that markets turn at fixed "support and resistance" pivot levels named **S1, S2, S3, R1, R2, R3**, etc. which are calculated from **dayPivot**, **dayClose**, **dayHigh**, and **dayLow**. There are many pivot level variants, for instance:  
      
    Persons Pivot levels:  
    **S1 = 2\*Pivot - High  
    S2 = Pivot - (High - Low)  
    S3 = 2\*Pivot - (2\*High - Low)  
    R1 = 2\*Pivot - Low  
    R2 = Pivot + (High - Low)  
    R3 = 2\*Pivot + (High - 2\*Low)  
      
    **Camarilla Pivot levels:  
    **S1 = Close - (High - Low) x 1.0833  
    S2 = Close - (High -Low) x 1.1666  
    S3 = Close - (High - Low) x 1.2500  
    S4 = Close - ((High - Low) x 1.5000  
    R1 = Close + (High - Low) x 1.0833  
    R2 = Close + (High -Low) x 1.1666  
    R3 = Close + (High - Low) x 1.2500  
    R4 = Close + ((High - Low) x 1.5000

### Example:

```c
_// simple gap trading system, 
// based on a publication by David Bean_ 
function run()
{
  BarPeriod = 10;
  LookBack = 100\*24\*60/BarPeriod; _// 100 days lookback_ 

  asset("SPX500");  
  Stop = 100\*PIP;
  TakeProfit = 40\*PIP;

  vars Prices = series(price());  
  var High = dayHigh(ET,1);
  var Low = dayLow(ET,1); 
  var Close = dayClose(ET,1);
_// enter a trade when the NYSE opens_ 
  if(High > 0 && Low > 0 && Close > 0 
    && timeOffset(ET,0,9,30) == 0)
  {
    var Avg = SMA(Prices,LookBack);
    if(\*Prices > Close 
      && \*Prices < High
      && \*Prices < Avg)
      enterShort();
          
    if(\*Prices < Close 
      && \*Prices > Low
      && \*Prices > Avg)
      enterLong();
  }
}
```
