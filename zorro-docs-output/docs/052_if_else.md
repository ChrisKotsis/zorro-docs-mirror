# if .. else

## if (comparison) { ... }

## else { ... }

If the [comparison](comparisions.md) or expression between the round brackets is **true** or non-zero, all commands between the first pair of winged brackets are executed. Otherwise all commands between the second pair of winged brackets following **else** will be executed. The **else** part with the second set of commands can be omitted. The winged brackets can be omitted when only one instruction is to be executed dependent on the comparison.

### Example:

```c
if (((x+3)<9) or (y==0))   _// set z to 10 if x+3 is below 9, or if y is equal to 0_
  z = 10;  
else    
  z = 5;_// set z to 5 in all other cases_
```
