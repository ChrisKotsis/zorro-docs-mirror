# Saxo Bank Plugin

Saxo Bank is a Danish broker that provides currencies, stocks, and ETFs. The Saxo Bank plugin was designed specifically to work with Saxo Bank's V2 Web API. You need [Zorro S](restrictions.md) for using the plugin.

For using the Saxo plugin you need either a valid API token, or a Client ID and Secret. The steps:

*   On the Saxo Bank OpenAPI website, create a live or demo "application" for your trading sessions.
*   In the form on the application website, enter **[http://127.0.0.1:31022/](http://127.0.0.1:31022/)** for the Redirect URL.
*   If you have a permanent **token**, enter it in the **User** field, and keep the **Password** field empty.
*   If you have no token, enter the **client ID** in the User field, and the **secret** in the password field.
*   Start the session. With client ID and secret, you will be redirected to a website where you enter your **user ID** and **password**.
*   Zorro will then automatically request a token and start trading.

### Supported broker commands

The Saxo plugin supports the [brokerCommand](113_brokerCommand.md) function with the following commands:

*   **GET\_DELAY**
*   **SET\_DELAY**
*   **GET\_WAIT**
*   **SET\_WAIT**
*   **SET\_PATCH**

### Remarks

*   The SAXO API is NFA compliant. The [NFA flag](018_TradeMode.md) must be set, no long and short positions must be open simultaneously, and positions must be closed in FIFO compliant way. [Virtual hedging](019_Hedge_modes.md) mode is recommended.
