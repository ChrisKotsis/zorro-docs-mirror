# What's New?

# What's new?

### Updating Zorro 2.62 / 2.64 to Zorro 2.70 - questions and answers

*   The data format in 64-bit mode has changed. Recompile your 64-bit C++ scripts.
*   How do I update a live trading Zorro without interrupting? The procedure is described under [Trading](trading.htm#update).
*   Why do I get **error messages** when the script previously compiled fine? Most likely due to improved error detection, a name conflict with a new keyword, or a deprecated variable or function. Deprecated keywords are defined in **legacy.h**, which can be included for still using them.
*   Why do I get a different backtest result? Most likely due to new price histories, new asset parameters, or other changes. You can easily find out by comparing both logs.
*   Why can't I test the new Z system? You need recent historical data. Get it from the [Zorro download page](https://zorro-project.com/download.php).
*   Why are my carefully edited settings gone? You probably edited them in a wrong place. Updates overwrite default settings. Keep individual settings in individual files, like **ZorroFix.ini**, **Z1.ini**, **Z2.ini**, etc. They won't be overwritten.
*   The [Fill](198_Fill_modes.md) mode was changed. Limit entries and exits now fill at the current price. The previous limit fill behavior can be activated with the new Fill mode 2. It [TR\_FRC](018_TradeMode.md) is not set, fill prices are now rounded to the point size of the asset.
*   The format of the parameter files (**\*.par**) was changed. Parameters and training results are now stored in CSV format.

The latest published beta version or the latest release candiate are available on the Zorro Download Page. [Zorro S features](restrictions.md) can be unlocked in beta versions with a valid Zorro license. [Z strategies](zsystems.md) are not included in beta versions. A list of fixed bugs can be found under [bugs](bugs.md).  

# Future Zorro features

If you want a new Zorro function, feature, or a new broker plugion, there are two ways to get it. You can either pay us for implementing it, and donate the feature to the community. Or you can suggest it on the [User Forum](https://opserver.de/ubb7/ubbthreads.php?ubb=cfrm&c=1) in the Zorro Future section. There you can also comment or support features suggested by other users. We normally implement any suggested feature when it is useful (please give a usage example), popular (supported by other users), backwards compatible (won't break existing scripts), and efficient (saves a lot of code in a script). How long it takes depends on the usefulness of the feature and how hard it is to implement. Donated features have priority.

*   The commission per asset can now be set up in the **[AssetsFix.csv](013_Asset_Account_Lists.md)** file and by script in the [Commission](191_Spread_Commission.md) variable. The simulation now simulates a spread/commission account, instead of a pure spread account.
*   In the SNB floor removal aftermath, many brokers reduced their maximum leverage from 400:1 or 200:1 to 100:1. The simulated default account (**AssetsFix.csv**) was also changed to 100:1 leverage, which affects the profit of most systems.
*   The **Z4** and **Z5** systems are expired and have been removed from the strategy pool.
*   The [Z3 system](zsystems.md) now also got an equity curve trading mechanism.
*   The currently profitable and suspended components of the **Z12** system are now displayed in a [asset/algo matrix](zsystems.md) with green and red rectangles.

*   The [account selection system](013_Asset_Account_Lists.md) was implemented for multiple accounts and/or multiple MTR4 clients (Zorro S only).

*   The [MTR4 bridge](mt4plugin.md) now supports multiple MTR4 instances on the same PC (Zorro S only). To connect to a particular MTR4 account, either the account number can be manually entered in Zorro's \[User\] field, or the [account selection system](013_Asset_Account_Lists.md) can be used.
*   The [\-d](027_Command_Line_Options.md) command line option allows to pass a **#define** statement to the script (Zorro S only). This way many different tasks can be automatized with the same script.

*   The [memory](171_memory.md) function can be used for determining the current memory footprint of the script, and for finding memory leaks.
*   The [reverse](buylong.md) functions are convenient for limiting the number of trades. Their use is explained in [workshop 5](tutorial_fisher.md).

*   [OptimalF](016_OptimalF_money_management.md) factors are now also calculated for long and short trades together. This gives a more precise result than averaging the long and short OptimalF factors.

*   Slippage is now recorded while live trading, and displayed in the [performance report](012_Performance_Report.md) in total and per trade.
*   An additional algorithm (VO) was added to the Z1 system, increasing the annual return to about 280%
*   After 6 months live test the [Z3](zsystems.htm#income) and [Z5](zsystems.htm#income) trade systems have been released.
*   C source generated by machine learning functions is now stored in **.c** files instead of **.rul**.
*   The [plotMAEGraph](147_plotProfile.md) function can produce MAE distribution graphs and similar charts.

*   The **AVG** flag now allows to [plot](146_plot_plotBar.md) a value as an average curve over all oversampling cycles.
*   A **Laguerre** filter was added to the [filters](129_filter_renorm.md).
*   Comparing a function pointer with a **var** or **float** value - this can happen when forgetting the () of a function call - will now generate a compiler error.
*   The [info](143_printf_print_msg.md) and [progress](144_progress.md) commands display text and color signals in Zorro's info window and progress bar.

*   The **Z12**, **Z12fx**, and **Z12nfa** combined strategies have been removed because they were found less profitable than trading Z1 and Z2 separately. Reason is an internal mechanism that evaluated open trade profits for trade decisions, which does not work well across opposite strategies such as the Z1 trend trading and the Z2 counter trend trading systems.

### Zorro 1.05 (January 2013)

*   The **Total down time** - the time spent below a preceding equity peak - is now displayed in the [performance report](012_Performance_Report.md).

*   [Trade functions](018_TradeMode.md) can now also be used for individual entry limits.
*   Price history files are not anymore automatically downloaded at the begin of a new year - this confused beginners and was a bad idea anyway. Instead the [assetHistory](loadhistory.md) function was implemented.
*   A new broker plugin with the ForexConnectâ¢ API interface has been implemented. It provides a more stable connection than the previously used Order2Goâ¢ broker plugin.
*   Logging in to the broker with several Zorro instances on the same PC will now generate an error message.
*   The **Z1** / **Z2** system components are now optionally filtered with the results of an out-of-sample test with the real trading parameters. This reduces the backtest performance, but should improve the real trading performance.
