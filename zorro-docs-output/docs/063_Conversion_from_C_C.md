# Conversion from C++, C#

# Lite-C for C/C++ programmers

Zorro's lite-C compiler uses the familiar syntax of C based languages such as C, C++, C#, or Javascript. Although it has some differences to allow a simpler compiler structure and faster compiling, it is 'compatible enough' to access the Windows API and even use complex external C++ libraries such as DirectX or OpenGL. Therefore it can be used to write any normal computer program (see **[Mandelbrot](scripts.md)**).

The differences of lite-C to standard C/C++ are listed here:

### No early if(A && B) abort

The **&&** and **||** operators are aliased with **and** and **or**, but can of course still be used. In C/C++, comparisons are early aborted when a **&&** is encountered and the expression so far evaluated to **false**, or when a || is encountered and the expression evaluated to **true**. Lite-C always calculates the expressions up to the end; the order of comparisons plays no role. This requires a different syntax for checking the value of a struct pointer and its element in the same expression:
```c
if((ptr != NULL) && (ptr->element == ..)) .. _// C/C++_
if(ptr != NULL) if(ptr->element == ..) .. _// lite-C_
```

### Trinary operators

Lite-C does not support the **comparison ? expression : expression;** syntax. Use the [ifelse](162_ifelse_valuewhen.md) statement instead.
```c
x = (x<0 ? -1 : 1); _// C/C++_
x = ifelse(x<0,-1,1);  _// lite-C_
```

### Infinite loops

Lite-C requires the continuation statement in a [for](012_Performance_Report.md) loop. So don't use **for(;;)** for infinite loops..
```c
for(;;) ... _// C/C++_
while(1) ... _// lite-C_
```

### Multiple operations in one command

Lite-C does not support the comma for clustering multiple operations in one command.
```c
x = 2, y = 2; _// C/C++_  
x = y = 2;    _//_ _lite-C_
x = 2; y = 2; _// lite-C_
```

### Struct and array initialization

In C/C++ structs can be initialized just like arrays, by giving a list of member values. This is only supported for numerical arrays in lite-C. Lite-C can initialize structs by directly setting their elements (see [structs](structs.md)).

### Struct copying

In C++, structs can be copied into each other with the '**\=**' operator. In lite-C, use **memcpy** for copying structs or arrays:
```c
_// C++:_
D3DXVector3 vecA, vecB;
...
vecA = vecB;

_// lite-C:_
D3DXVector3 vecA, vecB;
...
memcpy(&vecA,&vecB,sizeof(D3DXVector3));
```

### Struct returning

In C++, functions can return structs. In lite-C, return struct pointers instead.

### sizeof

In C/C++, **sizeof** is a built-in function. In lite-C, it's a macro with some restrictions for structs and arrays (see [structs](structs.md)).

### Enums

Enums are not supported and must be replaced by defines:
```c
enum RGB { RED=1; BLUE=2; GREEN=3 }; _// C/C++_
  
#define RED 1 _// lite-C_
#define BLUE 2
#define GREEN 3
```

### Unions

Union members of the same type can be substituted by a **#define**, and union members of different type can be treated as a different members of the struct. Example:
```c
typedef struct S\_UNION { 
   int data1;
   union { int data2; float data3; };
   union { int data4; int data5; };
} S\_UNION; _// C/C++_
  
typedef struct S\_UNION { 
   int data1;
   int data2;
   float data3;
   int data4; 
} S\_UNION; _// lite-C_
#define data5 data4
```

If the struct size must not change, or if for some reason the program requires different variable types to occupy the same place in the struct, a special conversion function can be used to convert the type of a variable without converting the content:

```c
typedef struct S\_UNION { 
   int data1;
   union { int data2; float data3; };

} S\_UNION; _// C/C++_
...
S\_UNION s\_union;
s\_union.data3 = 3.14;
  
typedef struct S\_UNION { 
   int data1;
   int data2;
} S\_UNION; _// lite-C_
#define data3 data2
...
int union\_int\_float(float x) { return \*((int\*)&x); }
...
S\_UNION s\_union;
s\_union.data3 = union\_int\_float(3.14);
```

### Function pointers

In C/C++, function pointers are declared like this: **int (\*foo)(int a, int b);**. In lite-C there's no difference between function prototypes and function pointers: **int foo(int a, int b);**. See details under [pointers](apointers.md).

### Signed, unsigned, extern, const, register...

In lite-C, variables are only defined by their type; further qualifiers are not used. **Float**, **double**, **var**, **long**, **int** are generally signed, and pointers, **char** and **short** are generally unsigned, according to the normal way they are used. The **include\\litec.h** file contains definitions for all usual unsigned variables like **DWORD** or **WORD** that are used in Windows functions. So using unsigned variables normally does not cause any problems. However you need to take care when variables exceed their range. For instance, subtracting **1** from **(DWORD)0** results in **\-1** under lite-C, but in **0xFFFFFFFF** in standard C/C++.

### Relaxed variable and function type checking

Lite-C allows a lot of things where a C++ compiler would issue a warning, such as assigning an int to a pointer, or not returning a value from a function. This relaxed checking is heavily used in the predefined scripts for making the code shorter and less complicated, but it also allows the user to make more mistakes.

### main() and run() functions

The **main()** function works like in C. The **run()** function indicates that the program is a strategy script. It is called once before the start of the strategy for initialization, and then once for each bar.

### Using C library or Windows API functions

Lite-C already contains the most often used functions from the standard C/C++ libraries - they are listed in **<litec.h>**, which is automatically included in all scripts without explicit [#include](020_Included_Scripts.md) statement. So you normally won't need to include C headers such as **stdio.h** or **math.h**. If you need a function that is not contained in **<litec.h>**, add it as described under [Using the Windows API](litec_api.md). Here's a brief instruction of how to add an external function to lite-C:

*   Find out in which Windows DLL the function is contained. C library function are normally found in the **mscvrt.dll**. You can use a free DLL browser, for instance the **DLL Export Viewer** from [http://www.nirsoft.net](http://www.nirsoft.net), for checking which DLL contains which function.
*   Declare a function prototype in your source code. In most cases you can directly copy the prototype from the **.h** header file that accompanies the DLL, or from the documentation to the C library.
*   Additionally to the prototype, either add a **#define PRAGMA\_API** line for initializing the function prototype, f.i. **#define PRAGMA\_API MessageBox;user32!MessageBoxA** as described in the API example. Or, for dynamic initalization, add a **DefineApi** call in your main function.

If you need certain structs or variable types that are not yet contained in **include\\windows.h** or in the other standard include files, just add them from their original file either into your script. If you think that a certain function, struct, or variable type is often needed, suggest its inclusion on the Zorro future forum.
