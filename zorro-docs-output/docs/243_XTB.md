XTB offers free access to their API. The connection is made through TCP sockets. Link to API their documentation: [http://developers.xstore.pro/documentation/#introduction](http://developers.xstore.pro/documentation/#introduction).  
  
This plugin allows to connect to their API from Zorro. It was written by Olivier Mallet in Win32 C++ under Visual Studio 2017. It can be downloaded from [https://github.com/olmallet81/XTBZorroPlugin](https://github.com/olmallet81/XTBZorroPlugin). The project is MIT-licensed; see the contained LICENSE.md file for more details. To install the plugin, simply place the binary file **XTB.dll** in the **Plugin** folder where Zorro is installed.

Zorro login fields for XTB:

<table style="border: 1px solid #000000"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: #CCCCCC"><strong>User:</strong></td><td>XTB User</td></tr><tr><td style="background-color: #CCCCCC; height: 20px;"><strong>Password:</strong></td><td style="height: 20px">XTB Passwordt</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Remarks

*   History is not supported, since XTB does not provide any historical data download service.
*   Market and limit orders are supported. The plugin caps limit/stop orders to 50% of the opened trade current position, otherwise the API does not close a trade with such an order attached.
*   A log file is automatically generated at each connection to XTB and dumped into the folder **C:\\Zorro\\Log\\XTB** by default. To adjust this path to your own Zorro folder path, please modify the line 63 in the header file **XTB.h**.
*   The source code of the plugin is available on the author's GitHub page.
*   This plugin was not developed by oP group. For support or reporting problems, please contact the author on his GitHub account or on the [Zorro user forum](http://www.opserver.de/ubb7/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=465410#Post465410).
