# while, do

## while (comparison) { instructions... }

## do { instructions... } while (comparison) ;

Repeats all instructions between the winged brackets as long as the [comparison](comparisions.md) between the round brackets is true or evaluates to non-zero. This repetition of instructions is called a loop. The **while** statement evaluates the comparison at the begin, the **do..while** statement at the end of each repetition.

### Remarks:

*   If you want the loop to run forever, simply use the value 1 for the comparison - 1 is always true.
*   Loops can be prematurely terminated by [break](acrt-break.md), and prematurely repeated by [continue](acrt-continue.md).
*   The winged brackets can be omitted when the loop contains only one instruction.

### Example:

```c
x = 0;
while(x < 100) _// repeat while x is lower than 100_
  x += 1;
```
