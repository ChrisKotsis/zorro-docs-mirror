# timer

## timer(): var

High precision timer function. Can be used to measures the time between calls for testing function execution speed and time optimizing the script for faster training.

### Returns:

Time elapsed since Zorro start in milliseconds (1/1000 sec).

### Remarks:

*   This function uses the Pentium performance counter register. The returned value has a precision of a few nanoseconds, depending on the processor clock rate.

### Example:

```c
...  
var Time = timer();  
myfunction();  
printf("\\nmyfunction call time = %.3f ms",timer()-Time); _// execution time in microsecond accuracy for the function call_  
...
```
