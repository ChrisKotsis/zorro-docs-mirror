# Technical Indicators and Technical Analysis

**Technical Analysis** is based on the belief that 'technical indicators' give insight into the current and future market situation. A **technical indicator** is a function that retrieves information from a [time series](091_series.md) of prices or trade volumes, and converts them to an output that can be used as a **trade signal** for buying or selling at the right moment. For instance, the **Simple Moving Average** (**SMA**) indicator with a **Time Period** 100 adds the last 100 prices and divides the sum by 100, this way getting the average price of the last 100 bars. If the current price rises above the average, some traders believe that prices will further rise, and take this as a buy signal. It the price falls below the average, they believe that prices will further fall and they must sell.

Indicators usually generate buy or sell signals when they reach a threshold, cross each other, or cross the price curve. About 1000 different indicators are published in books and trading magazines, from the very simple to the very bizarre. The most often used are available in Zorro's indicators and time series library. The library contains moving averages, oscillators, bands, momentum, strength indices, divergence, support and resistance, linear and polynomial regression, signal processing, and machine learning. It is divided in several sections:

*   **Indicators** \- common technical indicators, some new, some old, some useful, listed below in alphabetical order.
*   [Candle Patterns](005_Bars_and_Candles.md) - library of fixed candle patterns used by Japanese rice traders in the 18th century.
*   [Series Analysis](116_Statistics_Transformations.md) - functions for transforming time series and retrieving statistical and other properties.
*   [Spectral Analysis](129_filter_renorm.md) - functions for analyzing or filtering time series by their frequency components and cycles.
*   [Normalization](071_cdf_erf_dnorm_qnorm.md) - functions for scaling and compressing time series, often needed for machine learning.
*   [slope](124_slope_line.md), [line](124_slope_line.md) - functions for connecting points on the price curve.
*   [crossOver](121_crossOver_crossUnder.md)/[Under](121_crossOver_crossUnder.md), [rising](123_rising_falling.md)/[falling](123_rising_falling.md), [peak](122_peak_valley.md)/[valley](122_peak_valley.md) - functions for detecting events in a time series.

Aside from the indicators and time series functions, price curves and portfolio performance can also be analyzed with other methods:

*   [Trade Statistics](winloss.md) and [System Statistics](116_Statistics_Transformations.md)
*   [Pattern Detection](detect.md) (finding special wave forms)
*   [Predict](131_predict.md) (forecasting peaks, valleys, or crossings of indicators)
*   [Order Flow Analysis](ordercpd.md)
*   [Commitment Of Traders](cot.md) report
*   [Seasonal Strength](138_Seasonal_Strength.md)
*   [Currency Strength](ccy.md)
*   [Pivot Points](119_dayHigh_dayLow.md)
*   [Special Bars](005_Bars_and_Candles.md) (Renko, Range, Point-and-Figure etc.)
*   [Polynomial Regression](136_polyfit_polynom.md) (adapting a polynomial to the price curve)
*   [Fuzzy Logic](087_Fuzzy_Logic.md) (non-binary logic functions)
*   [Markowitz](105_markowitz.md) (mean/variance optimization)
*   [Machine Learning](advisor.md) (neural networks, decision trees, candle pattern evaluation, and various data mining methods)
*   [Cold Blood Index](ddscale.md) (verifying the validity of a live trading system by comparing with the backtest)

Most indicators use the TA-Lib indicator library by Mario Fortier ([**www.ta-lib.org**](http://www.ta-lib.org)) and Zorros **indicators.c** library. Both are open source and included in the **Zorro\\Source** folder. The most usual indicator categories are marked:

 Mkt  = Market State, f.i. for detecting trend or cycle regime,  
 Avg  = Averaging or lowpass filter for curve smoothing,  
 Rng  = Indicator based on price ratios or differences,  
 Osc  = Oscillator, a measure usually in 0..100 range.

Indicators that do not fall under any above category are not marked.

If you need an indicator that is is missing, simply add it. Most technical indicators are primitive and can be implemented in a few minutes with a few lines of code. How to implement an indicator is described in [Workshop4a](tutorial_lowpass.md) and in the Petra on Programming series on [Financial Hacker](https://financial-hacker.com/). The file **indicators.c** contains the source codes of many nonstandard indicators, so you can use it as learning material for adding more complex indicators.

## AC(vars Data): var

Osc Accelerator Oscillator by Bill Williams; the difference of the [AO](#a0) indicator (see below) and its 5-bar simple moving average ([SMA](#sma)). Believed to indicate acceleration and deceleration of a 'market driving force' (whatever that means). For **Data** normally a [MedPrice](#medprice) or [price](022_Price_History.md) series is used. Source code in **indicators.c**.

## ADO(): var

Osc Accumulation/Distribution Oscillator: **((Close-Low)-(High-Close))/(High-Low)**. Ranges from **\-1** when the close is the low of the bar, to **+1** when it's the high. Supposed to gauge supply and demand by determining whether traders are generally "accumulating" (buying) or "distributing" (selling). This indicator was published in many individual variants to the formula, but none of them seems any better than the other. Uses the current asset price series. Source code in **indicators.c**.

## ADX(int TimePeriod): var

## ADX(vars Open, vars High, vars Low, vars Close, int TimePeriod): var

Osc Average Directional Movement Index. Moving average of the **[DX](#dx)** indicator (see below). The first version uses the current asset price series and does not support **TimeFrame**. The returned values range from 0 to 100.  

## ADXR(int TimePeriod): var

Osc Average Directional Movement Index Rating. The average of the current **ADX** and the **ADX** from **TimePeriod** bars ago. Uses the current asset price series and does not support **TimeFrame**.

## Alligator(vars Data): var

Avg Alligator Indicator by Bill Willams. Consist of three lines: blue = **SMA(13)** delayed by 5 bars; red: **SMA(8)** delayed by 2 bars; green: **SMA(5)**. Indicates a down trend with lines in the order blue-red-green (top to bottom), and an uptrend with green-red-blue. The closer the Alligator’s lines move, the weaker the trend gets and vice versa. Does not contain the additional 3 bars lag of the original Alligator algorithm (use **Data+3** for that). For **Data** normally the high/low average ([MedPrice](#medprice) series) is used. Result in **rRed**, **rGreen**, **rBlue**. Source code in **indicators.c**.

## ALMA(vars Data, int TimePeriod, int Sigma, var Offset): var

## ALMA(vars Data, int TimePeriod): var

Arnaud Legoux Moving Average. Based on a Gaussian distribution with a bias towards the begin of the **Data** series (i.e. more recent prices). Parameters: **Sigma** (distribution width, default **6**); **Offset** (bias factor, default **0.85**). Source code in **indicators.c**.

## AO(vars Data): var

Avg Awesome Oscillator by Bill Williams; simply the difference of a 5-bar and a 34-bar [SMA](#sma). For **Data** normally a [MedPrice](#medprice) or [price](022_Price_History.md) series is used. Source code in **indicators.c**.  

## APO(vars Data, int FastPeriod, int SlowPeriod, int MAType): var

Osc Absolute Price Oscillator; a more general version of the [AO](#ao). Returns the difference between two moving averages. Parameters: **FastPeriod** (Number of period for the fast MA), **SlowPeriod** (Number of period for the slow MA), **[MAType](#matype)** (Type of Moving Average).  

## Aroon(int TimePeriod): var

Osc Aroon indicator. Consists of two lines (Up and Down) that measure how long it has been since the highest high/lowest low has occurred within the time period. Uses the current asset price series. Does not support **TimeFrame**. Result in **rAroonDown**, **rAroonUp**.  

## AroonOsc(int TimePeriod): var

Osc Aroon Oscillator. Calculated by subtracting the Aroon Down from the Aroon Up. The return value will oscillate between +100 and -100. Uses the current asset price series. Does not support [**TimeFrame**](177_BarPeriod_TimeFrame.md).  

## ATR(int TimePeriod): var

Rng Average True Range. A measure of price volatility; useful for calculating stop loss or profit target distances. Formula: **ATR = (ATR1 \* (TimePeriod-1) + max(High,Close)-min(Low,Close)) / TimePeriod**, where **ATR1** is the **ATR** from the last bar. Uses the current asset prices. [**TimeFrame**](177_BarPeriod_TimeFrame.md) must be zero or positive. The function internally creates [series](091_series.md) when [**TimeFrame**](177_BarPeriod_TimeFrame.md) is **\> 1**, (see remarks). See also: [Volatility](033_W4a_Indicator_implementation.md), [CVolatilty](#cvolatilty), **[TrueRange](#truerange)**, **ATRS**.

## ATR(vars Opens, vars Highs, vars Lows, vars Closes, int TimePeriod): var

Rng Average True Range from arbitrary price series, with arbitrary offset and time frame. Use this function when [**TimeFrame**](177_BarPeriod_TimeFrame.md) is not constant, but changes from bar to bar, f.i. when skipping bars outside market hours or aligning to the end of day.

## ATRS(int TimePeriod): var

Rng Simple Average True Range. **[SMA](#sma)** of the **[TrueRange](#truerange)** over the **TimePeriod**, using the current asset price series. A measure of price volatility, simpler to calculate than the **ATR**, but adapting slow to volatility changes and thus less suited for stop loss / profit targets. Used by the [MTR4](021_Conversion_from_other_platforms.md) platform instead of the real ATR. Does not support **TimeFrame**. Source code in **indicators.c**.  

## AvgPrice(): var

Average Price. Simply (Open+High+Low+Close)/4 with the current asset price series.  

## BBands(vars Data, int TimePeriod, var NbDevUp, var NbDevDn, int MAType)

Bollinger Bands. Consist of three lines; the middle band is a moving average (usually a 20 periods **SMA**) of the **Data** series. The upper and lower bands are **NbDevUp** standard deviations above and **NbDevDn** standard deviations below the middle band. The bands widen and narrow when the volatility of the **Data** series is higher or lower, respectively. They collapse to a line when the standard deviation is less than **0.0001**. Result in **rRealUpperBand**, **rRealMiddleBand**, **rRealLowerBand**. Parameters: **NbDevUp** (Deviation multiplier for upper band, usually **2**), **NbDevDn** (Deviation multiplier for lower band, usually **2**), **MAType** (Type of Moving Average, usually **MAType\_SMA**). Example in **Indicatortest.c**.

## BBOsc(vars Data, int TimePeriod, var NbDev, int MAType): var

Osc Bollinger Bands Oscillator; the percentage of the current value of the series within the Bollinger Bands.

## Beta(vars Data, vars Data2, int TimePeriod): var

Beta value. A measure of a single asset's prices versus the overall market index. The asset price is given in **Data** and the market index price (f.i. S&P 500, DAX, etc) is given in **Data2**. The algorithm calculates the change between prices in both series and then stores these changes as 2-dimensional points. The x value of any point is the **Data2** (market) change and the y value is the **Data** (asset) change. The beta value is the slope of a linear regression line through these points. A beta of 1 is simple the line y=x, so the asset varies percisely with the market. A beta of less than one means the asset varies less than the market and a beta of more than one means the asset varies more than the market.  

## BOP(): var

Balance Of Power; simply (Close - Open)/(High - Low). Uses the current asset price series.  

## CCI(int TimePeriod): var

Osc Commodity Channel Index. Variation of the price from its statistical mean, typically oscillates between +/-100. Formula: **CCI = (TypPrice-SMA(TypPrice)) / (.015 x SMA(Numerator))**. Uses the current asset price series. Does not support **TimeFrame**.

## CCYI(vars Data, int TimePeriod): var

Ehlers' Correlation Cycle Indicator. Measures the Spearman correlation of the **Data** series with a sine wave. Source code in **indicators.c**. Details on [Financial Hacker](https://financial-hacker.com/petra-on-programming-the-correlation-cycle-indicator/).

CCYI rate of change; the first derivative of the CCYI. Source code in indicators.c.

## CCYIState(vars Data, int TimePeriod, var Threshold): var

Mkt Market state based on the CCYI. Measures the phase angle difference between the **Data** series and a correlated sine wave, and returns 1 for rising trend regime, -1 for falling trend regime, and 0 for cycle regime. The critical angle difference in degrees is set with the **Threshold** parameter (0..45). Source code in **indicators.c**. Details on [Financial Hacker](https://financial-hacker.com/petra-on-programming-the-correlation-cycle-indicator/).

## ChandelierShort(int TimePeriod, var Multiplier): var

Chandelier exit; the highest price of **TimePeriod** minus the [ATR](#atr) multiplied with **Multiplier**. Normally used as a trailing [Stop Loss](188_Stop_Profit_Trail_Entry.md), for keeping trades in a trend and preventing an early exit as long as the trend continues. Source code in **indicators.c**. Does not support **TimeFrame**. Example in the [TMF](018_TradeMode.md) chapter.

## CGOsc(vars Data, int TimePeriod): var

Osc Center of Gravity oscillator, by John Ehlers; computes the deviation of prices from their center within the **TimePeriod**. Can be used to identify price turning points with almost zero lag. Source code in **indicators.c**.

## Chikou(_int Shift_): var

Chikou line belonging to the [Ichimoku](#ichimoku) indicator; simply a delayed Close moved forward by **Shift**. Uses the current asset price series. Source code in **indicators.c**. The traditional Ichimoku requires a future peeking Chikou line (**Shift = -26**); this can be achieved by setting **Shift = 0** and moving the rest of the Ichimoku forward by **Offset = 26**.  

## CMO(vars Data, int TimePeriod): var

Osc Chande Momentum Oscillator. Similar to the **[RSI](#rsi)**, but divides the total data movement by the net movement ((up - down) / (up + down)).

## Coral(vars Data): var

Avg Coral Indicator, simply a [T3](#t3) with **TimePeriod = 60** and **VolumeFactor = 0.4**. Source code in **indicators.c**.

## ConnorsRSI(vars Data, int RSIPeriod, int StreakPeriod, int RankPeriod): var

Osc Indicator by Larry Connors, mean of a 3 period **[RSI](#rsi)** on **Data**, a 2 period RSI of the recent up/down streak, and the [percent rank](transform.htm#percentrank) of the recent change. Fluctuates between 0 and 100 and believed to indicate the overbought (high values) or oversold (low values) level. The function internally creates [series](091_series.md) (see remarks). Source code in **indicators.c**.

## CTI(vars Data, int TimePeriod): var

Ehlers' Correlation Trend Indicator. Measures the Spearman correlation of the **Data** series with a rising trend. Source code in indicators.c.

## DChannel(int TimePeriod)

Donchian Channel; the minimum and maximum value of the **[priceHigh](022_Price_History.md)** and ****[priceLow](022_Price_History.md)**** functions over the time period. Basis of the famous **Turtle Trading System**. Uses the current asset price series. Does not support **TimeFrame**. Result in **rRealUpperBand**, **rRealLowerBand**.  

## DCOsc(vars Data, int TimePeriod): var

Osc Donchian Channel Oscillator; the percentage of the current **Data** value within the Donchian Channel. Uses the current asset and current [TimeFrame](177_BarPeriod_TimeFrame.md).  

## Decycle(vars Data, int CutOffPeriod): var

Ehlers' Decycler, a low-lag trend indicator; simply **Data - [HighPass2](129_filter_renorm.md)(Data,CutOffPeriod)**. Removes all cycles below **CutOffPeriod** from the **Data** series and keeps the trend. The function internally creates [series](091_series.md) (see remarks). Source code in **indicators.c**.

## DEMA(vars Data, int TimePeriod): var

Avg Double Exponential Moving Average.

## Divergence(vars Highs, vars Lows, vars Data, int TimePeriod): int

Mkt Regular or hidden divergence. Draws lines through the two most prominent peaks and valleys of the **Highs** and **Lows** series, and compares with lines through the two most prominent valleys and peaks of the **Data** series within the **TimePeriod**. **Highs** and **Lows** are usually from a price curve, while **Data** is from an oscillating indicator, such as **MACD**, **CCI**, **RSI**, **Stoch**, etc. Some traders believe that a divergence between the lines predicts a trend change. **Bullish regular divergence** means that the price makes lower lows, while the oscillator does not. **Bearish regular divergence** means that the price makes higher highs, while the oscillator does not. **Bullish hidden divergence** means that the oscillator makes higher highs, while the price does not. **Bearish hidden divergence** means that the oscillator makes lower lows, while the price does not. The function returns:  
**0** - No divergence  
**1** - Bullish regular divergence  
**2** - Bearish regular divergence  
**4** - Bullish hidden divergence  
**8** - Bearish hidden divergence.  
The returned value can be a combination, f.i. **5** = **1+4** = bullish regular + bullish hidden divergence. All combinations are possible.   
The slope of the determining line (movement per bar) is stored in **rSlope**. Source code in **indicators.c**.

## DPO(vars Data, int TimePeriod): var

Osc Detrended Price Oscillator; believed to detect early changes in price direction. **DPO = Data\[0\] - SMA(Data\[n/2+1\],n)**, where **n** is the **TimePeriod**. Source code in **indicators.c**.  

## DX(int TimePeriod): var

## DX(vars Open, vars High, vars Low, vars Close, int TimePeriod): var

Osc Directional Movement Index by Welles Wilder, who discovered that "the interaction of sun, moon, and earth is the basis of all market movement". In case that celestial bodies refrain from moving the market, he also invented the DX, which he believed to indicate trend strength. The values range from 0 to 100, but rarely get above 60. The first **DX** version uses the current asset price series and does not support **TimeFrame**. Formula: **DX = 100 \* abs(PlusDI-MinusDI) / (PlusDI+MinusDI)**. For **[PlusDI](#plusdi)** and **[MinusDI](#minusdi)** see the description below.

## EMA(vars Data, int TimePeriod): var

Avg Exponential Moving Average. Emphasizes more recent data values. It uses the formula **EMA = alpha \* data + (1-alpha) \* EMA1**, where **alpha** is **2.0/(TimePeriod+1)**, and **EMA1** is the previous EMA value. The higher the time period, the smaller is **alpha** and the higher is the smoothing effect of the **EMA** formula. The function requires a **Data** length of **TimePeriod+[UnstablePeriod](181_LookBack_UnstablePeriod.md)+1**.

## EMA(var Input, int TimePeriod): var

## EMA(var Input, var alpha): var

Avg Exponential Moving Average as above, alternative version that uses a single variable as input and also accepts the **alpha** parameter (see above). Does not use **[UnstablePeriod](181_LookBack_UnstablePeriod.md)**, but creates an internal series.

## ER(vars Data, int TimePeriod): var

Osc Kaufman's Efficiency Ratio, the amount of price changes in the given interval in relation to the absolute price change. Source code in **indicators.c**.

## FractalHigh(vars Data, int TimePeriod): var

Fractal High, an indicator by Bill Williams, believed to signal when the market reverses (has nothing to do with fractals). Returns the highest **Data** value when it is in the center of the **TimePeriod**, otherwise **0**.

## FractalLow(vars Data, int TimePeriod): var

Fractal Low. Returns the lowest **Data** value when it is in the center of the **TimePeriod**, otherwise **0**.

## HAOpen(): var

## HAClose(): var

## HAHigh(): var

## HALow(): var

Haiken Ashi prices of the current bar, based on the current asset prices. Except for **HAClose**, the functions internally create [series](091_series.md) (see remarks). Source code in **indicators.c**.

## HH(int TimePeriod, _int Offset_): var

Highest value of the **[priceHigh](022_Price_History.md)** function over the **TimePeriod** ending with **Offset** (default **0**). F.i. **HH(3,1)** returns the highest price of the 3 bars before the current bar. Uses the current asset price series. Sets **rMaxIdx** to the bar offset with the highest price. [TimeFrame](177_BarPeriod_TimeFrame.md) > 1 is supported. Source code in **indicators.c**. See also [dayHigh](119_dayHigh_dayLow.md).  

## HMA(vars Data, int TimePeriod): var

Avg Hull Moving Average by Alan Hull; attempts to address lag as well as to smooth out some choppiness. Formula:**HMA(n) = WMA(2\*WMA(n/2) – WMA(n)),sqrt(n))**. The function internally creates a [series](091_series.md) (see remarks). Source code in **indicators.c**.

## HTDcPeriod(vars Data): var

Osc Hilbert Transform - Dominant Cycle Period, developed by John Ehlers. Hilbert transform algorithms are explained in Ehler's book "Rocket Science for Traders" (see [book list](links.md)). This function is equivalent, but less accurate than the [DominantPeriod](129_filter_renorm.md) function.

## HTTrendMode(vars Data): int

Mkt Hilbert Transform trend indicator - returns **1** for Trend Mode, **0** for Cycle Mode.

## IBS(): var

Osc Internal Bar Strength; relative position in percent of the close price with respect to the low to high range for the same period. Source code in **indicators.c**.  

## Ichimoku()

## Ichimoku(int PeriodTenkan, int PeriodKijun, int PeriodSenkou, int Offset)

Avg Ichimoku Kinko Hyo indicator. Invented by the journalist Goichi Hosoda in the 1930s, and today again in fashion due to its enormous number of colorful lines. The Ichimoku is a mix of the medium prices of 3 time periods. **Offset** (default 0) determines the bar for calculating the indicator, and can be used to shift all lines forward. The function returns 4 variables:  
  
**rTenkan = (HH+LL)/2** with **PeriodTenkan** (default **9**)  
**rKijun = (HH+LL)/2** with **PeriodKijun** (default **26**)  
**rSenkouA = (rTenkan+rKijun)/2**, shifted forward by **PeriodKijun**. Forms a "cloud band" with **rSenkouB**.  
**rSenkouB = (HH+LL)/2** with **PeriodSenkou** (default **52**), shifted forward by **PeriodKijun**  
  
Another line belonging to the Ichimoku, the **[Chikou](#chikou)** line, is future peeking and calculated separately. The function uses the current asset price series. It internally creates [series](091_series.md) when [**TimeFrame**](177_BarPeriod_TimeFrame.md) is **\> 1** (see remarks). Source code in **indicators.c**.

## KAMA(vars Data, int TimePeriod): var

Avg Kaufman Adaptive Moving Average. An exponential moving average adjusted by price volatility, so its time period becomes shorter when volatility is high.

## KAMA2(vars Data, int ERPeriod, int FastPeriod, int SlowPeriod): var

Avg Kaufman Adaptive Moving Average as above, but the volatilty detection period as well as the short and long time period can be set separately. Internally creates [series](091_series.md) (see remarks). Source code in **indicators.c**.

## Keltner(vars Data, int TimePeriod, var Factor): var

Avg Keltner Channel, by Charles Keltner. A Simple Moving Average - [SMA](#sma)**(Data,TimePeriod)** - with side bands in the distance **Factor \* ATRS(TimePeriod)**. Results in **rRealUpperBand**, **rRealMiddleBand**, **rRealLowerBand**. Source code in **indicators.c**.

## LL(int TimePeriod, _int Offset_): var

Lowest value of the **[priceLow](022_Price_History.md)** function over the **TimePeriod** ending with **Offset** (default **0**). F.i. **LL(3,10)** returns the lowest price between the last 10 and the last 13 bars. Uses the current asset price series. Sets **rMinIdx** to the bar offset with the lowest price. [TimeFrame](177_BarPeriod_TimeFrame.md) > 1 is supported. Source code in **indicators.c**. See also [dayLow](119_dayHigh_dayLow.md). 

## LSMA(vars Data, int TimePeriod, int Offset): var

Avg Least Squares Moving Average. Calculates a linear regression line over the recent **TimePeriod**, and returns the value of that line at the given bar **Offset** (**0** for the current bar). Negative offsets return future values of the regression line and can be used for forecasting. See also **QLSMA**, [polyfit](136_polyfit_polynom.md), [LinearReg](116_Statistics_Transformations.md), [predict](131_predict.md). Source code in **indicators.c**.  

## MACD(vars Data, int FastPeriod, int SlowPeriod, int SignalPeriod)

Rng Moving Average Convergence/Divergence. The **MACD** is an intermediate-term trend indicator, created by subtracting a 26-period Exponential Moving Average (**EMA**, see above) from a 12-period **EMA**. A nine-period **EMA** is then applied to the **MACD** result to create a 'signal line'. A **MACD** Histogram line is finally created from the difference of the **MACD** to its signal line. It is believed that the zero crossing of the histogram from below is a buy signal, zero crossing from above a sell signal. The formula is:  
   
**rMACD = EMA(Data,FastPeriod)-EMA(Data,SlowPeriod);  
rMACDSignal = EMA(rMACD,SignalPeriod);  
rMACDHist = rMACD - rMACDSignal;**  
   
Results in **rMACD**, **rMACDSignal**, **rMACDHist**. Returns: **rMACD**. Parameters: **FastPeriod** (time period for the fast MA), **SlowPeriod** (time period for the slow MA), **SignalPeriod** (time period for smoothing the signal line).  

## MACDExt(vars Data, int FastPeriod, int FastMAType, int SlowPeriod, int SlowMAType, int SignalPeriod, int SignalMAType)

Rng MACD with controllable MA type. Result in **rMACD**, **rMACDSignal**, **rMACDHist**.

Mkt Market Meanness Index by [Financial Hacker](http://www.financial-hacker.com/the-market-meanness-index/). Measures the mean reversal tendency of the market in a **0..100%** range. Random numbers have a MMI of 75%. Real prices are more or less autocorrelated, so the probability of a real price series to revert to the mean is less than 75%, but normally more than 50%. The higher it is, the 'meaner' the market behaves towards trend following systems. The Market Meanness Index can determine when trend following systems will become more profitable (MMI is falling) or less profitable (MMI is rising), and thus prevent losses in unprofitable periods.

Detects trend reversals very early. Output in the -1..+1 range. Source code in **indicators.c**. The function internally creates [series](091_series.md) (see remarks).

## Volatility(vars Data, int TimePeriod): var

Annualized volatility of the **Data** series; standard deviation of the logarithmic returns, multiplied with the square root of time frames in a year. **Data** must be a series of positive values, normally a price series. This is the standard measure of volatility used in financial models, such as the Black-Scholes model.  
  For irregular **Data** series, corrections can be required to annualize the volatilty for all time frames. If **Data** contains flat out-of-market periods, multiply the result with the square root of trading bars per day divided by bar periods per day (example: with 60 minute bars and 8 trading bars per day, multiply with **sqrt(8./24) = 0.58**). If **Data** has a variable number of bars per element by time frame synchronizing ([frameSync](frame.md)), divide the result by the square root of the average bars per time frame.  
  The function internally creates [series](091_series.md) (see remarks). Source code in **indicators.c**. A practical alternative for options calculations is **VolatilityOV**.

## VolatilityC(int TimePeriod, int EMAPeriod): var

An increase in the Chaikin Volatility indicates that a bottom is approaching, a decrease indicates that a top is approaching. **TimePeriod** is the period of the momentum (normally 10), **EMAPeriod** determines the smoothing (also, normally 10). Uses the current asset price series. The function internally creates [series](091_series.md) (see remarks). Source code in **indicators.c**.  

## VolatilityMM(vars Data, int TimePeriod, int EMAPeriod): var

Rng Min/Max volatility of the **Data** series; the difference of **MaxVal** and **MinVal** in the time period, smoothed by an EMA (set **EMAPeriod = 0** for no smoothing). The function internally creates a [series](091_series.md) when **EMAPeriod > 0** (see remarks). Source available in **indicators.c**. For the volatility of price candles, use [ATR](033_W4a_Indicator_implementation.md) or [ATRS](033_W4a_Indicator_implementation.md).

## VolatilityOV(int Days): var

Annualized volatility of the current asset, calculated over the given number of **Days** (usually 20) regardless of the bar period.

ZigZag indicator; converts the **Data** series into alternating straight 'legs' with at least the given **Depth** (in **Data** units) and **Length** (in bar units). For not missing legs, the **Depth** threshold should be sufficient low. **ZigZag** is non-predictive and can only identify trends in hindsight. Returned: **rSlope** (the slope of the last identified leg; upwards legs have a positive slope, downwards legs a negative slope); **rPeak** (the bar offset of the last identified peak); **rLength** (the number of bars of the last zig or zag that ends with **rPeak**). If a nonzero **Color** is given, the zigzag lines are plotted in the chart. Source code in **indicators.c**, example in **Indicatortest.c**.

### Usage example:

**MACD(Price,12,26,9)** calculates the standard MACD for the given **Price** series. The results are stored in the global variables **rMACD**, **rMACDSignal**, and **rMACDHistory**.

### Remarks:

*   The **TA-Lib** function prototypes are defined in **include\\functions.h**. The C++ source code of all included TA-Lib indicators is available in **Source\\ta\_lib.zip**. Some TA-Lib indicators that originally didn't work properly - such as Correlation or SAR - have been replaced by working versions. The C source code of most additional indicators that are not part the the TA-Lib is contained in **Source\\indicators.c**.
*   TA-Lib indicators can only be used between [INITRUN](013_Asset_Account_Lists.md) and [EXITRUN](013_Asset_Account_Lists.md), since TA-Lib and series management are released at end of the session. This restriction does not apply when the [STRAIGHT](018_TradeMode.md) flag is set.
*   All indicators are normally applied either on data [series](091_series.md), or on the price curve of the current asset. In the [INITRUN](013_Asset_Account_Lists.md), indicators return **0** and [LookBack](181_LookBack_UnstablePeriod.md) is automatically increased to the largest required lookback time by any used indicator.
*   Data series must cover the indicator's lookback period, which is often, but not always identical to the given **TimePeriod**. If the required lookback period by an indicator exceeds [LookBack](181_LookBack_UnstablePeriod.md), TA-Lib indicators will produce an [Error 046](errors.md) message. Other indicators might just crash or produce strange results, so make sure to set [LookBack](177_BarPeriod_TimeFrame.md) at least as high as than the maximum **TimePeriod** of any indicator plus the highest offset - if any - of the used series.
*   Some indicators internally create [data series](091_series.md), and thus must be called in the same order at any bar. They must therefore not depend on **if** conditions.
*   Recursive indicators - f.i. **EMA** or **ATR** - use a preceding value of itself as an input. Their results thus depend on their previous history. Recursive functions from the TA-Lib run over the whole [UnstablePeriod](181_LookBack_UnstablePeriod.md) at any call. This ensures reproducible results regardless of the number of preceding bars, but requires a longer lookback period and increases the backtest time. Recursive functions that are not from the TA-Lib (f.i. [LowPass](filter.md)) do not use this mechanism, but store their values from preceding calls in an internal series instead.
*   Some indicators return more than one value, f.i. **MACD**. The returned results are stored in global variables beginning with "**r**"; they can be accessed after the function is called.
*   [TimeFrame](177_BarPeriod_TimeFrame.md) affects subsequent data [series](091_series.md) and thus also affects all indicators that use these data series as input. The **TimePeriod** is then not in Bar units, but in time frame units. **TimeFrame** has no effect on indicators that do not use data series. The required lookback period of an indicator multiplies with the **TimeFrame** of its series.
*   The **MAType** can be any of **MAType\_SMA**, **MAType\_EMA, MAType\_WMA, MAType\_DEMA, MAType\_TEMA, MAType\_TRIMA, MAType\_KAMA, MAType\_MAMA, MAType\_T3**.
*   Indicators that rely on the standard deviation (f.i. Bollinger Bands) become inaccurate when the standard deviation is below 0.0001, as it is then assumed to be zero by the TA-Lib. This can happen on very short bar periods when the price does (almost) not move.
*   For writing your own indicators, have a look at [workshop 4a](tutorial_lowpass.md) and at the examples inside **indicators.c**. But please do not modify **indicators.c** - write the indicators in your own script, or in a dedicated script that you can then [include](020_Included_Scripts.md) in your strategies. If you need a complex indicator that you can not be easily add, please ask for it on the Zorro user forum.
