# exec

## exec(string Program, string Options, int Flags)

Execute an external program, open a document or URL, or run a script or batch file.

### Parameters:

**Program** - file name of the exe, batch file, document, URL to be opened. Use **"Editor"** for opening the script editor, **"Zorro"** for another Zorro instance.  
**Options** - command line parameter string to be passed to the program, or **0** for no command line options.  
**Flags** - **1** for waiting until the external program was terminated, **2** for hiding its window, otherwise **0**.

### Returns:

**0** if the program was not found or could not be started, otherwise the return code of the program in mode **1**, or the process ID in mode **0**.

### Remarks:

*   The **Program** parameter can specify a full path (from the root), a partial path (from the Zorro folder), or just a filename. In the latter case the **exec** function first looks for the file in the Zorro folder, and then in the in the folders specified by the system's PATH environment variable.
*   If the **Program** string does not have a filename extension, the **exec** function first tries the .COM extension, then the .EXE extension, then the .BAT extension, and finally the .CMD extension.
*   If the **Program** string contains a URL or the name of a document, the standard internet browser or the standard editor for that document is opened.
*   **'\\'** characters in strings, like for file paths, have to be given in C-Notation as **"\\\\"****.**
*   The external program can be controlled with the [keys](152_keys.md) function.
*   Data can be exchanged with the executed program through a text file; an example can be found under [Python](026_Python_Bridge.md).
