# #ifdef, #ifndef, #else, #endif

## #ifdef name

## #ifndef name

## #else

## #endif

Defined names can be used to to skip certain script lines dependent on previous [#define](060_define_undef.md)s. All script lines between **#ifdef** and **#endif** are skipped if **name** was not defined. Likewise, all lines between **#ifndef** and **#endif** are skipped if **name** was #defined. The **#else** statement reverses the line skipping or non-skipping.

### Example:

```c
#define SCALPING  
...   
#ifdef SCALPING  
  aut.nBarMinutes = 0;  
#endif
```
