# for

## for (initialization; comparison; continuation) { ... }

Performs the initialization, then evaluates the [comparison](comparisions.md) and repeats all instructions between the winged brackets as long as the comparison is true or non-zero. The continuation statement will be executed after the instructions and before the next repetition. This repetition of instructions is called a loop. Initialization and continuation can be any [expression](050_Expressions.md) or function call. A **for** loop is often used to increment a counter for a fixed number of repetitions.

### Remarks:

*   Loops can be prematurely terminated with [break](acrt-break.md), and prematurely continued with [continue](acrt-continue.md).
*   The winged brackets can be omitted when the loop contains only one instruction.
*   The notorious infinite **for** loop - **for(;;)** - is not supported in lite-C. For infinite loops, use **while(1)**.

### Example:

```c
int i;
for(i=0; i<5; i++) _// repeat 5 times_
  x += i;
```
