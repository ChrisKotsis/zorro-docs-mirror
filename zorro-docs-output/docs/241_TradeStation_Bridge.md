# TradeStation Bridge

# TradeStation Plugin

TradeStation is a Florida-based broker that supports many instruments, including stocks, options, futures, and futures options. The TradeStation plugin was designed specifically to work with TradeStation's v3 Web API. You need [Zorro S](restrictions.md) for using the plugin.

For using the bridge you need an API Key and API Secret. The steps:

*   Email TradeStation support and specifically request v3 keys.
*   Enter key and secret in the User and Password fields.
*   Log in with Zorro. You will be required to follow some high-security multi-factor authentication protocols.
*   Once that's completed, Zorro will print out the API Refresh Token in the log and then quit. \*\*Save the API Refresh Token\*\*.
*   Copy and paste the API Refresh Token into the password field with a space after the secret, as shown below. Save this permanently into your [Accounts.csv](013_Asset_Account_Lists.md) file, close the CSV file, and restart Zorro.
*    Henceforth, you will no longer need to follow authentication protocols, unless you change your API keys.

<table><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: #CCCCCC"><strong>User</strong></td><td>API Key</td></tr><tr><td style="background-color: #CCCCCC"><strong>Password</strong></td><td>API_Secret(space)Refresh_Token</td></tr></tbody></table>

For the first time authentication described above, the refresh token is not needed.
