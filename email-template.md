Subject: Request to Mirror Zorro Documentation for Modern AI Development Tools

Dear [Zorro Creator's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I'm a long-time user of Zorro and appreciate the excellent platform you've created for algorithmic trading.

I'm writing to request your permission for a project that would benefit the Zorro community. I'd like to create a GitHub mirror of the Zorro documentation to make it accessible through Context7, a documentation service that integrates with modern AI coding assistants like Claude, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot.

## The Problem

AI coding assistants are becoming increasingly popular for development, but they often generate outdated or incorrect code because they can't access current documentation. Context7 solves this by providing real-time access to up-to-date documentation.

## The Solution

With your permission, I would:

1. Create a read-only mirror of the Zorro documentation on GitHub
2. Convert the HTML documentation to Markdown format for better compatibility
3. Submit it to Context7's index (free service)
4. Clearly attribute all content to the Zorro Project
5. Include links back to the official documentation
6. Add a disclaimer that this is an unofficial mirror

## Benefits to the Zorro Community

- Developers using AI assistants would get accurate, up-to-date Zorro code
- Increased visibility for Zorro among developers using modern tools
- No cost or maintenance burden on your end
- All traffic would still be directed to your official site for downloads

## Important Notes

- This would be strictly documentation only (no software, no proprietary code)
- The repository would clearly state it's unofficial and link to zorro-project.com
- I would respect any limitations or conditions you specify
- The repository can be made private or removed at any time per your request

I've already created a crawler that can convert the documentation while preserving all the valuable content and structure. I'm ready to proceed as soon as I have your blessing.

Would you be open to this? I'm happy to discuss any concerns or modifications you'd like.

Thank you for considering this request and for all your work on Zorro.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Subject: Permission to Create Documentation Mirror for AI Tools

Hi [Name],

I'm a Zorro user working with AI coding assistants. These tools need access to current documentation to generate correct code.

May I create a GitHub mirror of Zorro's documentation for Context7 (a free documentation index)? This would:
- Help AI tools generate accurate Zorro code
- Increase Zorro's visibility
- Link back to your official site
- Be clearly marked as unofficial

No software or proprietary content would be included - documentation only.

Would this be acceptable to you?

Thanks,
[Your Name]
